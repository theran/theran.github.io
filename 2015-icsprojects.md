[lt]: http://theran.lt/


Departments involved are:

* [Information and Computer Science][ics]

[ics]: http://ics.aalto.fi

With additional support from 

* The AScI Thematic Program "Challenges in Large Geometric Structures and Big Data" (financial support)


## About AScI Internships

AScI interns will work with mentors at the [Aalto Science Institute][asci] (AScI) 
in Otaniemi.  

__Dates:__ The internships run from June 1–August 31 (can be flexible)

__Salary:__ About €1600/month, depending on experience (e.g., credits earned)

__Additional perks:__ In addition, AScI interns receive

* Reimbursement for an economy class round-trip ticket to the country where they study
* Finnish language and culture classes in June and July
* The possibility to rent housing  from the [Aalto Student's Union][ayy] at below-market rates

EU or Finnish residency is _not required_ to take up the internship.  (Citizens of 
[Annex II countries][annexii] do _[not][visafree]_ need to apply in advance 
for an entry visa of any type. [Aalto Human Resources][hr] will give specific 
instructions to selected students.)

## Project descriptions 

### Flows and circulations in large-scale data analysis

__Field of study: Computer science, Mathematics, Statistics__

__Contact person(s): Louis, Petteri__

__Professor: Petteri Kaski__

Behind the buzzword "Big Data" is the task to extract structure out of extremely 
large sets of measurements generated by applications at "Internet" or "societal"
scale.  Working at this scale is computationally challenging, but also offers
the possibility for novel analysis methods.  In this project we will explore 
how to extract structure from very large graphs arising from sources such as 
financial markets and public transport networks.

You will learn the combinatorial, algebraic, and algorithmic tools that 
underly state-of-the art algorithms for large graphs.  Along the way 
you will gain intuition on the problem by performing descriptive data 
analysis.

Students with a strong background in mathematics or theoretical computer science
are especially encouraged to apply. Programming skills are a necessity.

### Motif search with massively parallel computing

__Field of study: Computer science__

__Contact person(s): Petteri, Louis__

__Professor: Petteri Kaski__

Recent theoretical work in combinatorial search has leveraged
implicit representations of polynomial generating functions 
on substructures of the input.  In this project, we will 
combine this emerging algorithmic theme with that of massively
parallel computing technologies such as GPGPU and MIC from 
high-performance computing. At Aalto we have access to substantial
computing resources both within the [School of Science][science-it] 
and through [CSC, the Finnish IT Center for Science][csc]. 

[science-it]: http://science-it.aalto.fi/resources/
[csc]: https://research.csc.fi/guides

You will learn how to exploit clusters of compute nodes with co-processors such as 
GPUs and use technologies such as CUDA and OpenCL. Along the way, you will
become profficient with the scaffold technologies required to 
deploy on a modern scientific cluster.

Students with experience either in algebraic algorithms or 
parallel computing are especially encouraged to apply. Strong 
programming skills and familiarity with the Unix environment are 
strongly encouraged.
