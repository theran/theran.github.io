## Information for incoming AScI interns

This page collects some practical information for students 
taking part in the Summer program on 
[Mechanical function from geometry and topology][mechgt].
Since Aalto HR and the AScI coordinator are in charge of 
communication with respect to employement matters, this 
page should be considered informative.  However, we have tried
to make it as accurate as possible.

## The offer letter and work contract

This is the first step. Once you've accepted, you will need to send:

* Your transcript
* The [Aalto personal data form][form5]

to Minna Lind.  These are enough to generate an official offer
letter and work contract.  (Your transcript is used to calculate the 
exact salary, which is at least 1600€ / mo.)

_Note about banking:_ Aalto can pay you directly into bank accounts 
in (at least) the [SEPA area][sepa], United States, and Canada. Just
enter your normal banking information into the personal data form.

## Before you arrive
Here are some tasks you'll need to take care of before you arrive.

_Finalize your start and end dates:_ 

The next step is to finalize your start and end dates.  This should 
be coordinated with Daniel, Marcelo, and Louis, and reported to Dr. Lind.

The standard dates, are Jun. 1–Aug. 31.  These are also most convenient 
in terms of housing, but we have some flexibility.

_Apply for housing:_ 

Once your dates are fixed, you need to make a 
housing reservation with the [Aalto Student's Union][ayy].  AScI 
will make sure your application gets accepted.

You should apply for  the "_Teekkari Village Single room_" option.
This is in Otaniemi, near Aalto's campus.  The other options 
are 45+ minutes away by public transport (and not in downtown 
Helsinki either).

The cost in previous years was about 250€ / mo and requires a ~250€ deposit.

The applicaiton process is as follows:

1. Go to AYY´s [housing application pages](https://campus.ayy.fi/)
2. [Sign up](https://campus.ayy.fi/application/signUp) as a user in to the AYY system.  _Important:_ Make sure to mention in the “Personal notes” text box that you are “Summer accommodation applicant for 2015”
3. Use the user ID and password from the previous step to log in to the [Campus system](https://campus.ayy.fi/). Click on "Own Applications" and then "New application".  Select the queue "Teekkari Village single room/ dorm room".
4. Click “Next: Personal details” and fill in your personal details.
5. Click “Next: Companions” and then click “Send the application”.

If you are interested in the other housing options, repeat the process 
with the different queues.

_Set up your student status:_ 

Fill out the [exchange student form][form421]
and return it to Jaako Kölhi. You do _not_ need to put any supporting 
documentation, despite what the form says.  (Since you have been accepted
already, this step is a formality.)

_Book your plane tickets:_

You need to buy your own plane ticket. After you arrive, 
you will be reimbursed for an economy-class, round-trip ticket to Helsinki
from the country where you study.  If the costs are comparable, e.g., US vs. Canada
or all the flights are within Europe, we can probably make an exception, but
check in advance.  There is a maximum reimbursement of 1200€, 
so book in advance to get a good rate. 

Make sure to keep your boarding passes and ticket receipt.  (Electronic 
boarding passes are fine.)

_Check your health insurance status:_ 

During work hours you will have access to [Diacor][diacor] through Aalto, 
and also student
health via the student's union.  However, you won't have access to the
Finnish public system, so check that your insurace will cover emergency 
care in Finland.

_Get a visa if you need one:_ 

You do not need a visa if you can normally enter the Schengen 
area without one (the so-called [Annex II][anexii] countries). Otherwise, you will need a visa.  You can get one at 
any [Finnish consulate][cons] in a country where you are a 
permanent resident or study.

## After you arrive
Once you arrive, you will need to get things set up.  Do all of these 
tasks right away.

_Get a tax card:_ 

In order to be paid, you will need to get a 
tax card from the [Finnish tax authority][vero].  The office 
you need to go to is [Into Finland][into], since it can 
issue you an ID number and tax card at the same time. You don't 
need an appointment. You'll need to bring:

* Your passport or European ID card
* Your work contract
* Your address in Finland
* A confirmation of your tax status at home (e.g., a pay stub or tax return)
* A confirmation that you have health insurance and social insurance in your home country

Ask for a "progressive tax card" (there are [details on VERO's site][prog]). This can result in a much lower rate and 
can't increase it. Past interns have paid between 0-5% on the amount over
the tax-exempt amount of 500€ or so.

_Bring your tax card to HR:_ 

Bring your tax card and signed work contract to 
Noora Koskivaara. This will allow you to start being paid and activate you 
in the HR system.

_Open your Aalto IT account:_ 

TBD
