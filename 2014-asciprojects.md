## Overview 

These four independent 
projects all relate to the theme of meta-materials, which 
will be explored from the perspectives of physics and math.  The idea
is that the projects will mix theoretical investigation with 
practical experimentation.

The projects will be hosted at [AScI][asci] and supervised jointly by:

* [Marcelo Dias][marc]
* [Daniel Rayneau-Kirkhope][dan]
* [Louis Theran][lt]

[asci]: http://asci.aalto.fi/


Departments involved are:

* [Information and Computer Science][ics]
* [Physics][phys]

[phys]: http://physics.aalto.fi
[ics]: http://ics.aalto.fi

With additional support from 

* The AScI Thematic Program "Challenges in Large Geometric Structures and Big Data" (financial support)
* Aalto Media Factory's [Fab Lab][fablab] (time on laser cutters, 3-d printers, and CNC machines)

## About AScI Internships

AScI interns will work with mentors at the [Aalto Science Institute][asci] (AScI) 
in Otaniemi.  

__Dates:__ The internships run from June 1–August 31 (can be flexible)

__Salary:__ About €1600/month, depending on experience (e.g., credits earned).

__Additional perks:__ In addition, AScI interns receive

* Reimbursement for an economy class round-trip ticket to the country where they study
* Finnish language and culture classes in June and July
* The possibility to rent housing  from the [Aalto Student's Union][ayy] at below-market rates

EU or Finnish residency is _not required_ to take up the internship.  (Citizens of 
[Annex II countries][annexii] do _[not][visafree]_ need to apply in advance 
for an entry visa of any type. [Aalto Human Resources][hr] will give specific 
instructions to selected students.)

## Project descriptions 

### Design of mechanical meta-materials

__Field of study: Structural mechanics, Physics, Applied Mathematics__

__Contact person(s): _Marcelo_, Daniel, Louis__

__Professor: Olli Ikkala__

__[Apply Now][apply]__

Mechanical structures (including 2-d and 3-d lattices, polyhedral 
surfaces, etc.) have recently been shown to display a wide variety of 
interesting behaviour including:

* negative Poisson's ratio
* negative coefficient of thermal expansion
* symmetric collapses.

In this project, we will try to understand the kinematics and mechanics of 
of these kinds of materials via simple modelling and table-top experiments,
using 3-d printing.  

You will learn how to create mechanical meta-materials in the lab and gain intuition 
through interacting with them experimentally. Then you'll see how to formalise your
hypotheses in terms of equilibrium analysis of elastic and stiff materials.

Students in physics or mechanical engineering are especially encouraged
to apply.  Some experience with lab work or 3-d printing will be helpful, 
but is not required.

### Physics and geometry of structural mechanics

__Field of study: Structural mechanics, Physics, (Applied) Mathematics__

__Contact persons: _Daniel_, Marcelo, Louis__

__Professor: Mikko Alava__ 

__[Apply Now][apply]__

The mechanics of soft materials allows structures to be designed that undergo large elastic deformations. 
Understanding these theoretically is challenging, because these deformations tend to exhibit 
geometric non-linearity, even for structures designed from simple, repeating motifs.

In this project we will explore how elastic instability can be utilised to 
bring about novel, global mechanical properties. Following theoretical analysis, the possibility of 
fabrication of such geometries will be explored. 

You will learn the geometrical tools to understand the kinematics and degrees of freedom
in a structure; how to derive constitutive laws; and how to derive the mechanical
equilibrium equations for the structure, perform instability analysis and perturbation theory.

Students in physics or applied mathematics are especially encouraged to apply.  Some 
experience with numerical simulations, and finite element methods will be 
helpful but not required.  Some programming skill (e.g., Mathematica, MATLAB, 
Python, Java) is necessary.

### Boundary effects in isostatic systems

__Field of study: Math, Physics__

__Contact persons: _Louis_, Daniel, Marcelo__

__Professor: Petteri Kaski__

__[Apply Now][apply]__

Networks of stiff bars connected by rotational joints have recently 
been shown to exhibit behaviors associated with soft matter and 
quantum systems.  Because these kinds of networks (and also ones
arising in jamming) are either flexible or isostatic, boundary 
conditions used either in theoretical analysis or simulations 
take on an extra significance.

In this project, we will explore how different kinds of boundary 
conditions affect what can be seen about the geometry of bulk
motions.

You will learn the mathematical and computational tools for 
analyzing linkages.  Then you will apply them for making 
theoretical predictions about how boundary conditions on
finite patches of large systems affect what can be seen.
To get intuition, you will create models using 3-d printing 
and laser cutter.

### Configuration space design for origami sheets and lattice-linkages

__Field of study: Math, Physics, Computer Science__

__Contact persons: _Louis_, Marcelo, Daniel__

__Professor: Petteri Kaski__

__[Apply Now][apply]__

For finite linkages, Kempe's Universality Theorem states, roughly, that
any algebraic curve can be traced out by a mechanical linkage.  Recently,
linkages made by repeating small units have gotten a lot of attention 
because they can be adapted to exhibit a wide variety of interesting 
behaviors.

In this project, we will look at these stiff systems from the algebraic 
perspective, and try to understand how the topology of the unit cell or
crease pattern can affect the geometric behavior.

You will learn the mathematical and computational background for 
explicitly computing configuration spaces of small examples and 
how to express interesting physical properties algebraic-geometrically.
After analyzing existing examples, you will try to derive a set of gadgets 
that can be used to generate pre-specified motions.  Along they 
way, you'll build models to test out new idea and get a feel for 
the problem.

Experience with computer algebra systems such as Macaulay 2 is 
helpful, but not required.
