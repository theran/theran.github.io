title: Affine rigidity and conics at infinity 
---

We prove that if a framework of a graph is neighborhood affine rigid in $$d$$-dimensions (or has the stronger property of 
having an equilibrium stress matrix of rank $$n−d−1$$) then its edge directions lie on a conic at infinity if and only 
if the framework is ruled on a single quadric. This strengthens and also simplifies a related result by Alfakih. 
It also allows us to prove that the property of super stability is invariant with respect to projective transforms
and also to the coning and slicing operations. Finally this allows us to unify some previous results on the Strong
Arnold Property of matrices.
