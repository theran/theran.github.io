title: Global rigidity of complete bipartite graphs
year: 2021
---

This note gives a detailed proof of the following statement. Let $$d\in \mathbb{N}$$ and $$m,n\ge d+1$$, with $$m+n\ge \binom{d+2}{2}+1$$. Then the complete bipartite graph $$K_{m,n}$$ is generically globally rigid in dimension $$d$$.
