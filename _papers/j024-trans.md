title: Transverse rigidity is prestress stability
year: 2022

Recently, V. Alexandrov proposed an intriguing sufficient condition for rigidity, which we will call "transverse rigidity". We show that transverse rigidity is actually equivalent to the known sufficient condition for rigidity called "prestress stability". Indeed this leads to a novel interpretation of the prestress condition.
