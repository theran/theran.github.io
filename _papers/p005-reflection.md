title: Generic rigidity of reflection frameworks
year: 2012
---

We give a combinatorial characterization of generic minimally rigid reflection
frameworks. The main new idea is to study a pair of direction networks on the same graph
such that one admits faithful realizations and the other has only collapsed realizations.
In terms of infinitesimal rigidity, realizations of the former produce a framework and
the latter certifies that this framework is infinitesimally rigid.
