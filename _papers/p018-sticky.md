title: Rigidity for sticky disks
year: 2018
---

In this paper, we prove that any packing of $$n$$ disks with generic radii can have at most $$2n - 3$$ 
disk pairs in contact. If we do not allow any of the existing contacts to be broken (modeling a 
collection of sticky disks), then the packing is rigid iff it has exactly $$2n - 3$$ contacts. 
Thus we obtain a Laman-like characterization of rigidity for sticky disks under a generic 
radii assumption.
