title: Algebraic matroids in action
year: 2020
doi: 10.1080/00029890.2020.1689781

In recent years, surprising connections between applications including
algebraic statistics and the rigidity of bar-and-joint frameworks have sparked
a resurgence of interest in various notions of algebraic independence, which
may be formalized by the notion of an algebraic matroid. In each of these
settings the fundamental problem is to determine the extent to which certain
unknowns depend algebraically on given data. We give an introduction to the
theory of algebraic matroids motivated by examples that are accessible with an
undergraduate background in mathematics and that illustrate the breadth of
their potential.
