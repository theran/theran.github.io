title: Universal Rigidity of Ladders on the line
year: 2022
---

In "Universal rigidity on the line, point order" it is shown, answering a question of Jord√°n and Nguyen, that universal rigidity of a generic bar-joint framework in $$\mathbb{R}^1$$ depends on more than the ordering of the vertices. The graph $$G$$ that was used in that paper is a ladder with three rungs. Here we provide a general answer when that ladder with three rungs in the line is universally rigid and when it is not.
