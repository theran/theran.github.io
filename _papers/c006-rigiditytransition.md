title: The rigidity transition in random graphs

conferenceprocname: SODA’11

As we add rigid bars between points in the plane, at what point is there a giant
(linear-sized) rigid component, which can be rotated and translated, but which has no
internal flexibility? If the points are generic, this depends only on the combinatorics
of the graph formed by the bars. We show that if this graph is an Erdős-Rényi random
graph $$G(n, c/n)$$, then there exists a sharp threshold for a giant rigid component to
emerge. For $$c < c_2$$, w.h.p. all rigid components span one, two, or three vertices,
and when $$c > c_2$$, w.h.p. there is a giant rigid component. The constant $$c_2 \approx
3.588$$ is the threshold for 2-orientability, discovered independently by Fernholz and
Ramachandran and Cain, Sanders, and Wormald in SODA'07. We also give quantitative bounds
on the size of the giant rigid component when it emerges, proving that it spans a $$(1 −
o(1))$$-fraction of the vertices in the $$(3+2)$$-core. Informally, the $$(3+2)$$-core is
maximal induced subgraph obtained by starting from the $$3$$-core and then inductively
adding vertices with 2 neighbors in the graph obtained so far.
