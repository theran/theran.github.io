We present a novel algebraic combinatorial view on low-rank matrix completion based on
studying relations between a few entries with tools from algebraic geometry and matroid
theory. The intrinsic locality of the approach allows for the treatment of single entries
in a closed theoretical and practical framework. More specifically, apart from
introducing an algebraic combinatorial theory of low-rank matrix completion, we present
probability-one algorithms to decide whether a particular entry of the matrix can be
completed. We also describe methods to complete that entry from a few others, and to
estimate the error which is incurred by any method completing that entry. Furthermore, we
show how known results on matrix completion and their sampling assumptions can be related
to our new perspective and interpreted in terms of a completability phase transition.
