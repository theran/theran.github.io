title: Frameworks with coordinated edge motions
year: 2018
---

We develop a rigidity theory for bar-joint frameworks in Euclidean $$d$$-space in which 
specified classes of edges are allowed to change length in a coordinated fashion, subject 
to a linear constraint for each class. This is a tensegrity-like setup that is 
amenable to combinatorial "Maxwell-Laman-type" analysis. We describe the generic 
rigidity of coordinated frameworks in terms of the generic $$d$$-dimensional rigidity properties 
of the bar-joint framework on the same underlying graph. We also give Henneberg and 
Laman-type characterizations for generic coordinated rigidity in the plane, 
for frameworks with one and two coordination classes.
