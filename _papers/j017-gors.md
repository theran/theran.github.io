title: Generically globally rigid graphs have generic universally rigid frameworks
year: 2020

We show that any graph that is generically globally rigid  in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ has a
realization in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ that is both generic and universally rigid. 
This also implies that the graph
also must have a realization in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ that is both infinitesimally 
rigid and universally rigid;
such a realization serves as a certificate 
of generic global rigidity.  

Our approach
involves an algorithm by Lov√°sz, Saks and Schrijver
that, for a sufficiently connected graph, 
constructs a general position orthogonal
representation of the vertices, and a result of Alfakih that
shows how this representation leads to a stress matrix and a
universally rigid framework of the graph.
