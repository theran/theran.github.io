Let $$\mathbf{p}$$ be a configuration of $n$ points in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ for some $$n$$ and some $$d \ge 2$$. 
Each pair of points has a Euclidean length in the configuration. Given some  
graph $$G$$ on $$n$$ vertices, we measure the point-pair lengths corresponding
to the edges of $$G$$.

In this paper, we study the question of when a generic $$\mathbf{p}$$ in $$d$$ dimensions
will be uniquely determined (up to an unknowable Euclidean transformation) 
from a given set of point-pair lengths together with knowledge of $$d$$ and $$n$$.
In this setting the lengths are given simply as a set of real numbers; they are 
not labeled with the combinatorial data that describes which 
point-pair gave rise to which length, nor is data about $$G$$ given.

We show, perhaps surprisingly, that in terms of generic uniqueness, labels have
no effect. A generic configuration is determined by an unlabeled set of point-pair
lengths(together with $$d$$ and $$n$$) iff it is determined by the labeled edge lengths.
