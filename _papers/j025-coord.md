We develop a rigidity theory for bar-joint frameworks in Euclidean $$d$$-space in which specified classes of edges are allowed to change length in a coordinated fashion that requires differences of lengths to be preserved within each class. Rigidity for these coordinated frameworks is a generic property, and we characterize the rigid graphs in terms of redundant rigidity in the standard $$d$$-dimensional rigidity matroid. We also interpret our main results in terms of matroid unions.
