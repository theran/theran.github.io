title: Universal rigidity on the line, point order
year: 2021
---

We show that universal rigidity of a generic bar and joint framework $$(G,p)$$ in the line depends on more than the ordering of the vertices. In particular, we construct examples of one-dimensional generic frameworks with the same graph and ordering of the vertices, such that one is universally rigid and one is not. This answers, in the negative, a question of Jordan and Nguyen.
