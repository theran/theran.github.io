title: Lines induced by bichromatic point sets
year: 2011
---

An important theorem of Beck says that any point set in the Euclidean plane is either
"nearly general position" or "nearly collinear": there is a constant $$C>0$$ such that,
given $$n$$ points in the plane with at most $$r$$ of them collinear, the number of lines
induced by the points is at least $$Cr(n−r)$$. Recent work of Gutkin-Rams on billiards
orbits requires the following elaboration of Beck's Theorem to bichromatic point sets:
there is a constant $$C>0$$ such that, given $$n$$ red points and $$n$$ blue points in
the plane with at most $$r$$ of them collinear, the number of lines spanning at least one
point of each color is at least $$Cr(2n−r)$$.
