I am a Lecturer in Mathematics at St Andrews. 

Starting in Fall 2018, I'm organizing the [pure maths colloquium][seminar].

I like to work on problems that feature an interaction between geometry, combinatorics,
and algorithmic considerations. I also like theoretical problems that arise out of
concrete, applied scenarios.

I'm interested in discrete geometry generally, and the rigidity and flexibility 
of frameworks specifically, with connections to applications in physics, materials,
and machine learning.

For more detail, see the list of publications below, the 
[short overview][bio] or my [full CV][cv]. To find me, 
see my [contact information][contact].
