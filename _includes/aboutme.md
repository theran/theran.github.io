I am a Lecturer in Mathematics at St Andrews. 

I like to work on problems that feature an interaction between geometry, combinatorics,
and algorithmic considerations. I also like theoretical problems that arise out of
concrete, applied scenarios.

I'm interested in discrete geometry generally, and the rigidity and flexibility 
of frameworks specifically, with connections to applications in physics, materials,
and machine learning.

[short overview][bio] or my [full CV][cv]. To find me,
