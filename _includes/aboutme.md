I am a Lecturer in Mathematics at St Andrews. 

Starting in Fall 2018, I'm organizing the [pure maths colloquium][seminar].

I like to work on problems that feature an interaction between geometry, combinatorics,
and algorithmic considerations. I also like theoretical problems that arise out of
concrete, applied scenarios.

My main projects right now center around:

- The rigidity and flexibility of frameworks
- Algebraic and combinatorial approaches to machine learning and data analysis

For more detail, see the list of publications below, the 
[short overview][bio] or my [full CV][cv]. To find me, 
see my [contact information][contact].
