Throughout the years there have been introduced several notions of entropy 
to express the topological complexity of a certain dynamical system, group 
action or even an invariant foliation. A general goal in ergodic theory 
is to obtain variational principles that relate such topological
entropies with the entropy of (invariant) probability measures and, 
if possible, to construct probability measures which attain the maximum. 
In this talk I will talk about  the recent use of convex analysis to 
establish general variational principles for pressure functions  and 
to construct some generalized equilibrium states (joint work with A. 
Bis, M. Carvalho and M. Mendes)
