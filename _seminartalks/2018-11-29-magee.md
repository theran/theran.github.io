I'll begin by discussing Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture. This is an analog of the Riemann 
hypothesis for a special family of Riemann surfaces that feature heavily in number theory, for 
example in Wiles' proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. I'll explain how in the last 10 
years, number theorists have had to turn to Anosov dynamics to obtain the approximations to 
Selberg's conjecture that became relevant to emerging 'thin groups' questions about Apollonian 
circle packings and continued fractions. Then if I have time, I'll explain how I have proved an 
extension of Selberg's 3/16 theorem to higher genus moduli spaces, and point out some 
interesting ingredients of the proof.

Part of the talk is based on joint work with Oh and Winter and with  Bourgain and Kontorovich.
