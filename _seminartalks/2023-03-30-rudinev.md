The talk will describe the state of the art of the Erdös-Szemerédi sum-product conjecture, a central open question in arithmetic combinatorics. It will also sketch the proof of a new result showing that for a set $$A$$ of $$N$$ integers, each of which has a small number of prime factors (roughly, at most $$log log N$$ of them), either the product set $$AA$$ is *big* or there is a large subset, with *small* additive energy (alias the number of additive quadruples, or  the second moment of the convolution of $$A$$ with itself).

Quantitatively, what stands for *big* and *small* is optimal, up to sub-polynomial factors of $$N$$.
