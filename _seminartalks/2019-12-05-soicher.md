Semi-Latin squares generalise Latin squares, and are used in the
design of comparative experiments. My talk, including joint work with
R.A. Bailey, will focus on uniform semi-Latin squares, which generalise complete
sets of mutually orthogonal Latin squares and have excellent statistical optimality
properties. I will discuss the construction and properties of uniform semi-Latin squares, including connections with group theory, computation, and other types of combinatorial designs. This talk should be accessible to a general mathematical audience.
