 Over the past decades various advancements have appeared in the multiscale analysis of 
 random graphs (clusters, loops, patterns, ...) probably due to their prevalence on big 
 data. Motivated by random billiards, parallel to these results on random graphs many 
 ‘dynamicists’/geometers established analogous results for random surfaces. In this 
 talk we will present basics of this field and history, and present an overview of our 
 work on the spectral theory of random surfaces.

Joint work with Joe Thomas (Manchester), Etienne Le Masson (Cergy, Paris), Clifford Gilmore (Cork), Mostafa Sabri (Cairo)
