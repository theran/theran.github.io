We consider some classes of piecewise expanding maps in
finite dimensional spaces with absolutely continuous (with respect to
Lebesgue measure) invariant probability measures and derive an
entropy formula for such measures. Using this entropy formula, we
present sufficient conditions for the continuity of that entropy in
certain parametrized families of maps. We apply our results to a family
of higher dimensional tent maps. Joint work  with Antonio Pumariño.
