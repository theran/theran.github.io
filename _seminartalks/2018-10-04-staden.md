I will discuss Erdős–Rothschild type problems in discrete structures, in which we seek to maximise the number of non-Ramsey colourings. That is, the number of colourings of a discrete structure such that every colour class does not contain some forbidden substructure. For example, maximise the number of $$r$$-colourings without monochromatic

* $$k$$-cliques among all $$n$$-vertex graphs;
* Schur triples among all subsets of a given abelian group;
* Schur triples among all subsets of $$\{ 1,\ldots,n\}$$.

I will give an overview of the area, the number- and graph-theoretic tools which go into the proofs, and discuss some joint work with Oleg Pikhurko and Zelealem Yilma, and with Hong Liu and Maryam Sharifzadeh.
