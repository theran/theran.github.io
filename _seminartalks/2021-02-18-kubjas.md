 One of many definitions gives the rank of an $$m\times n$$ matrix $$M$$ as the smallest natural number such that M can be factorized as $$AB$$, where $$A$$ and $$B$$ are $$m\times r$$ and $$r\times n$$ matrices respectively. In many applications, one is interested in factorizations of a particular form. For example, factorizations with nonnegative entries define the nonnegative rank which is a notion that is used in data mining applications, statistics, complexity theory etc. Nonnegative rank has geometric characterizations using nested polytopes. I will give an overview how these nested polytopes are related to characterizations of the set of matrices of given nonnegative rank and uniqueness of nonnegative matrix factorizations.
