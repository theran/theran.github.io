Many combinatorial problems call for an object a little bit more
informative than a matroid to capture all the relevant information. In
the topology of torus arrangements, e.g., this extra information is of
arithmetic flavour.  I'll introduce the object Luca Moci and I defined
to answer this call -- matroids (of modules) over rings, the ring in
this case being Z -- and then show how their structure relates to
better-known matroid generalisations, in particular the valuated
matroids of Dress and Wenzel.
