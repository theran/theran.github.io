Computing the complexity of Markov bases is an extremely 
challenging problem; no formula is known in general and there are 
very few classes of toric ideals for which the Markov complexity has 
been computed. A monomial curve $$C$$ in $$\mathbb{A}^3$$ has Markov complexity $$m(C)$$ 
two or three. Two if the monomial curve is complete intersection and 
three otherwise. Our main result shows that there is no $$d\in \mathbb{N}$$ such 
that $$m(C) \leq d$$ for all monomial curves $$C$$ in $$\mathbb{A}^4$$. The same result is true 
even if we restrict to complete intersections. We extend this result 
to all monomial curves in $$\mathbb{A}^n, n  \geq 4$$.
