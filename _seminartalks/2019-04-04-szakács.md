 Inverse monoids are monoids equipped with an involutive inverse operation that 
 satisfies the identities $$mm^{-1}m=m$$ and $$mm^{-1}nn^{-1}=nn^{-1}mm^{-1}$$. They 
 can be considered as the abstractions of partial symmetries, and are one of the many 
 generalizations of groups. The Cayley graph of an inverse monoid need not be strongly 
 connected, nevertheless, the strongly connected components, called Schützenberger 
 graphs, form metric spaces. We prove that if a finitely presented inverse monoid has 
 tree-like Schützenberger graphs, then the Schützenberger graphs have regular geodesics,
 and the inverse monoid has a solvable word problem.
