An abstract polytope is a combinatorial object abstracted from the notions of polygons and polyhedra; we keep data about the incidence of objects (vertices, edges, faces, ... ) but discard all metric data. Thus it has objects of all possible dimensions from $$0$$ to $$r − 1$$, where $$r$$ is the rank.

A polytope is regular if its automorphism group acts transitively (and hence regularly) on the set of maximal flags (sets of mutually incident objects). For example, the $$r$$-dimensional simplex can be represented by taking the $$i$$-dimensional objects to be the $$(i + 1)$$- element sets of an $$(r+1)$$-set; its automorphism group is the symmetric group of degree $$n = r + 1$$. It can be shown that a polytope with automorphism group $$S_n$$ has rank at most $$n − 1$$, with equality if and only if it is the simplex.

After a sequence of results over the last decade, Maria Elisa Fernandes (Averio), Dimitri Leemans (Brussels) and I have proved:

__Theorem__: For any positive integer $$k$$, there is a positive integer $$c_k$$ such that the number of regular polytopes with automorphism group $$S_n$$ and rank $$n − k$$ (up to isomorphism and duality) is $$c_k$$ (independent of $$n$$) for $$n\ge 2k+3$$.

The sequence $$(c_k)$$ begins $$1, 1, 7, 9, 35, 48, \ldots$$. (No further terms are currently known.)

I will talk mostly about the background and history of this problem, with only a very brief sketch of the proof; the paper is over 40 pages long.
