An action of a group on a compact metric space is rational if there is an assignment of binary addresses to points in the space for which the elements of the group act as asynchronous, finite-state automata.  In this talk I will discuss the theory of rational actions and sketch a proof that any hyperbolic group acts rationally on its Gromov boundary.  This gives an embedding of any hyperbolic group into the group of rational homeomorphisms of the Cantor set defined by Grigorchuk, Nekrashevych, and Suschanskii.  This is joint work with Collin Bleak and Francesco Matucci.
