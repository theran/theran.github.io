Hierarchical geometries are found throughout nature as a means to extremal properties [1]. Gecko's remarkably adhesive toes [2], nacre's incredible resistance to fracture [3] and bones' stiff yet lightweight properties [4] are all dependent on utilisation of optimisation on multiple length-scales. Here I will introduce the hierarchical design principle with an example of a self-similar hierarchical frame optimised for compressive loading [5]. Following this, the effect of a single beam perturbation within such a structure will be analysed through analytic methods [6].
