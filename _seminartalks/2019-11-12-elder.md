Automatic groups arose in the 80s and 90s and were hotly studied. If a
group admits an automatic structure, many nice consequences follow such as
a quadratic time algorithm to  solve the word problem. Recently a new kind
of automatic group was defined: Cayley (graph) automatic groups preserve
the nice algorithmic properties, but the definition allows for a much
larger class of groups (for example, non finitely presented).

New work of Berdinsky and Trakuldit (Mahidol, Thailand) proposes a way to
quantify how close a Cayley automatic group is from being genuinely
automatic; I will describe their work and some new contributions and
questions, joint with Berdinsky and Taback (Bowdoin, USA)
