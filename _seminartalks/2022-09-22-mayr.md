Tarski's finite basis problem asks for a given finite algebraic structure $A$ whether the equational theory of $A$ is finitely axiomatizable. More explicitely, does there exist some finite set of identities true in $A$ that implies all identities true in $A$? McKenzie showed that this question is not decidable in general in 1996. Still partial results are known for many classes of algebras. I will review some of the long history of the problem, state open questions and present a recent approach on the finite basis problem for nilpotent loops.
