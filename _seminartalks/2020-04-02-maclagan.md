 Tropical geometry is geometry over the tropical semiring, where
multiplication is replaced by addition and addition is replaced by
minimum. This "tropicalization" procedure turns algebraic varieties
(solutions to polynomial equations) into polyhedral complexes, which
are combinatorial objects. A surprisingly large amount of information
about the variety is still present in tropical "combinatorial
shadow". In this talk I will introduce tropical varieties, and
indicate some of their applications, both inside and outside algebraic
geometry.
