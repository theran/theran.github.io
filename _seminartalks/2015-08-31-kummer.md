A real fibered morphism between two algebraic subvarieties of complex affine or projective space has the property that a point is mapped to a real point if and only if it is a real point itself. First we will give a collection of examples where real fibered morphisms pop up in several areas of mathematics. Then we will explain some general results on real fibered morphisms from a joint work with Eli Shamovich.
