 Recent results and open questions will be presented, related with some graphs encoding generating properties of finite and profinite groups. In particular, given a family $$\mathcal{F}$$ of groups, we will consider the graph whose vertices are the elements of a group $$G$$ and where two vertices $$x, y$$ in $$G$$  are adjacent if and only if the subgroup generated by them does not belong to $$\mathcal{F}$$.
