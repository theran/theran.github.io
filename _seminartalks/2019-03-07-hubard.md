I will give an overview of several results around the Ham Sandwich theorem. Conjectured by Steinhaus as the "leg of pork theorem" and proved by Banach, it states that for any three measures in 3 dimensional space (e.g. a slice of ham and the two pieces of bread), there exists a plane that cuts in half each of the three measures. Since then there has been a myriad of generalizations and applications to geometric analysis, incidence geometry and computational geometry. In this talk I will survey some of these results.
