 If $$A,B,C$$ are three finite sets in a field, under what assumptions can we find a point $$c$$ in $$C$$ such that $$A + cB$$ is much bigger than $$A$$? This is a variant of the Erdős-Szemerédi sum-product problem. I will briefly survey the problem in a number of fields. Then I will focus on the $$\delta$$-discretised version of the problem on the real line. This version is the most relevant one for fractal geometers.
