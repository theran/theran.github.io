Representation theory aims to study an algebraic object, often an algebra or a group, by understanding how it 'acts' on any given abelian group.  In particular, we may study an associative algebra $$A$$ by considering the *category $$\mathrm{Mod}(A)$$ of $$A$$-modules* with $$A$$-linear homomorphisms between them.  Similarly, when comparing two algebras $$A$$ and $$B$$, we ask when they have the same representation theory, i.e. when is the category $$\mathrm{Mod}(A)$$ equivalent to the category $$\mathrm{Mod}(B)$$.  In this case we say that $$A$$ is *Morita equivalent* to $$B$$.  It turns out that $$A$$ is Morita equivalent to $$B$$ if and only if $$B$$ is isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of a distinguished module in the category $$\mathrm{Mod}(A)$$ (called a finitely generated projective generator).

In this talk we will consider the notions of *tilting* and *cotilting equivalence*, which are widely-studied generalisations of Morita equivalence that allow us to detect equivalences between derived categories.  I will present joint work with Karin Baur, in which we give a new characterisation of cotilting modules over Artinian rings, as well as a classification of the cotilting modules over cluster-tilted algebras of type $$\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$$.  The latter classification is combinatorial and can be parametrised by maximal collections of non-crossing arcs on the annulus.
