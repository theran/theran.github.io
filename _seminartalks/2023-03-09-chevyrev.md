Recent years have seen a rapid development of rough analytic methods in the study of stochastic partial differential equations. In this talk, I will describe an application of these developments to the classical problem of constructing Euclidean field theories. In particular, I will present recent results on the stochastic quantisation of 2- and 3-dimensional Yang-Mills measures, which includes a proof of universality for the exactly solvable 2-dimensional measure. A key feature of these results is an interaction between gauge symmetries and renormalisation. Based on joint works with Ajay Chandra, Martin Hairer and Hao Shen.
