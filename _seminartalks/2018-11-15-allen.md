In Diophantine Approximation we are often interested in the Lebesgue and 
Hausdorff measures of certain $$\limsup$$ sets. In 2006, motivated by such 
considerations, Beresnevich and Velani proved a remarkable result --- the 
Mass Transference Principle --- which allows for the transference of 
Lebesgue measure theoretic statements to Hausdorff measure theoretic 
statements for $$\limsup$$ sets arising from sequences of balls in 
$$\mathbb{R}^k$$. Subsequently, they extended this Mass Transference 
Principle to the more general situation in which the $$\limsup$$ sets arise 
from sequences of neighbourhoods of "approximating" planes. In this talk, I 
aim to discuss two recent strengthenings and generalisations of this latter 
result. Firstly, in a joint work with Victor Beresnevich (York), we have 
removed some potentially restrictive conditions from the statement given by 
Beresnevich and Velani. The improvement we obtain yields a number of 
interesting applications in Diophantine Approximation. Secondly, in a joint 
work with Simon Baker (Warwick), we have extended these results to a more 
general class of sets which include smooth manifolds and certain fractal 
sets.
