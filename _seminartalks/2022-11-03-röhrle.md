 Tropical geometry is a modern branch of algebraic geometry. Its starting point is a process called tropicalization, which replaces complicated algebro-geometric objects by much easier to understand piecewise linear tropical objects. Ultimately this lead to a rich theory of geometry in its own right whose study is motivated by the great promise that learning more about tropical geometry will give us new insights into algebraic geometry. To make this come true we have to understand which tropical objects are actually algebraically meaningful, i.e. which arise by tropicalization. This is the realizability problem.
