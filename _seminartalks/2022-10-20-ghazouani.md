A lot of physical evidence and numerical experiments strongly suggests that the typical complex system is chaotic, in a sense that will be discussed. In this talk I will try to present some theoretical aspects of the question, and try to convince you that from a mathematical perspective, ubiquity of chaos is far from certain (and to this date completely open).
