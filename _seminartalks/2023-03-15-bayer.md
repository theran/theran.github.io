Birational geometry studies maps between algebraic varieties defined by rational 
functions. Recently, derived categories, stability conditions and wall-crossing 
have led to an entirely new approach to fundamental open questions in birational 
geometry. I will survey these developments, with an emphasis on Hyperkaehler 
varieties and cubic fourfolds.
