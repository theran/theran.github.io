Fourier analysis has proved a fundamental tool in analytic and combinatorial number theory, usually in the guise of the Hardy--Littlewood circle method. When applicable, this method allows one to asymptotically estimate the number of solutions to a given Diophantine equation with variables constrained to a given finite set of integers. I will survey recent work extending the range of applicability of Fourier methods, with a focus on nonlinear problems in additive combinatorics.
