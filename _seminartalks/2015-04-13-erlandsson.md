I will describe some joint work in progress with Juan Souto studying the asymptotic growth on the number $$n_k^S(L)$$ of multicurves with $$k$$ self-intersections of length at most $$L$$ on a hyperbolic surface $$S$$. More concretely, I we show that for small $$k$$, $$\frac{n_k^S(L)}{L^{6g-6}}$$ has a limit as $$L\to\infty$$. Moreover, when $$S$$ is the punctured torus, this
limit exists for any fixed $$k$$. In this talk I will outline some of the ideas that are used in proving these results.
