 In the 1960s, H. Furstenberg proposed a series of conjectures which, in different ways,
 aim to capture the heuristic principle that "expansions in different bases have no 
 common structure". I will discuss a sample of these conjectures, some which remain 
 open and some which have been established in recent years. These problems lie at the 
 intersection of Ergodic Theory and Fractal Geometry, but no previous background on 
 either area will be assumed.
