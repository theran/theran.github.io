Complex dynamics studies the behaviour under iteration of holomorphic and meromorphic functions. The first ones to develop this theory were P. Fatou and G. Julia in the 1920s. The area has attracted much attention after the 1980s when the use of computers allowed for the first pictures of the Mandelbrot set to be produced. In this talk we shall focus on the dynamics of transcendental entire functions. Through a series of examples, we will revise the main properties of the Fatou and Julia sets of these maps, present some of the latest developments in the field, and discuss open questions in the area.
