Let $$G$$ be a permutation group of degree $$n$$ on the domain $$\Omega$$,
and $$k$$ a positive integer with
$$k\le n$$. We say that $$G$$ has the *$$k$$-existential property*, or
*$k$-et*, if there exists a $$k$$-subset $$A$$ whose orbit under $G$
contains transversals for all $$k$$-partitions $$\mathcal{P}$$ of
$$\Omega$$.

This property is a substantial weakening of the $$k$$-universal
transversal property, or $$k$$-ut,
investigated by my coauthors, which required this condition to hold
for all $$k$$-subsets $$A$$ of the domain $$\Omega$$.

Both of these conditions relate to the regularity of transformation
semigroups. In the earlier work, the regularity of 
$$\langle G,t\rangle$$ for any
map $$t$$ of rank $$k$$ (with $$k < n/2$$) was shown to be equivalent to the
$$k$$-ut property. The question investigated in our new result is if
there is a $$k$$-subset $$A$$ of the domain such that $$\langle G, t\rangle$$ is
regular for all maps $$t$$ with image $$A$$. This turns out to be much
more delicate: the $$k$$-et property
(with $$A$$ as witnessing set) is a necessary, but not sufficient condition.

In this talk we give a nearly complete characterizations of both
$$k$$-et and its corresponding regularity condition in the case that
$$4\le k\le n/2$$.

This is joint work with João Araújo (Universidade Nova) and Peter
J. Cameron (St Andrews).
