A compact $$K\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$$ is called self-affine if there
exist affine contractions $$\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$$
such that $$K=\cup_{i=1}^{m}\varphi_{i}(K)$$. In the 1980s, Kenneth
Falconer introduced a value $$s$$, called the affinity dimension, which
is the ''expected'' value for the dimension of $$K$$. I will discuss
a recent project with Mike Hochman, building on our joint work with
Balázs Bárány, in which we establish the equality $$\dim K=s$$ under
mild assumptions.
