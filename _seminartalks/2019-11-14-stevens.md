 Between any pair of points lying in a plane over any field we can define a distance quantity. If we have a finite number of points, we then have a finite number if distances. The question I would like to talk about is: how many distances must occur between any set of points? 
 
This question was originally asked by Erd√∂s and, up to a logarithmic factor, resolved over the reals by Guth and Katz in 2010; I will discuss how the question can be approached over general fields. This is work joint with B. Murphy and M. Rudnev.
