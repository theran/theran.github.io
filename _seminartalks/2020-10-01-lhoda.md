In this talk I will describe two spaces of groups. The first is the Grigorchuk
space of marked groups, and the second is the Polish space of enumerated groups.
Both spaces provide a useful framework for the study of countable, discrete
groups. After a gentle introduction, I shall describe some recent results in the
field, such as the work of Minasyan, Osin and Witzel on quasi-isometric
diversity, and the work of Elayavalli and Goldbring on the generic version of
the von Neumann-Day problem. I shall also describe how some of my past and also
some recent work (in part with coauthors) fits into the picture.
