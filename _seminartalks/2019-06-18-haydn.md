We consider maps with invariant measures
and look at the time it takes for random points
to enter a given (positive measure) set.
For return times a theorem of Kac states that on
average the return times are the reciprocal of
the size of the return set. The actual return
times however have a distribution which typically
allows for arbitrarily long returns.
We want to consider a sequence of shrinking sets
that contract to a single point or, possibly, to
some more complicated zero measure set.
With good control over the shrinking target sets
one can prove meaningful limiting results
which  tend to be either a straight Poisson
distribution or a compound Poisson distribution.
