 There is a wealth of number systems, some of which are more classical than others. These number systems give different representations of real numbers, for example binary, non-integer base and continued fraction. The associated theory has led to a number of solutions to practical problems, for instance in signal processing, coding theory and modeling of quasicrystals. In this talk we will discuss various aspects of non-integer base expansions, and highlight some connections to the set of badly approximable numbers, concluding with a number of open questions.
