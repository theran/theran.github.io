Community detection in complex networks: structural versus annotated communities

Abstract:
Detecting communities in networks is one of the most popular topics of
network science. Despite this, a little is known about the structure
of annotated communities (communities based on node annotations).
While classical community detection algorithms use only connectivity
and thus identify structural communities, it is often assumed that
nodes grouped in this way share some common properties. This does not
have to be true. My work is set out to investigate this connection: in
which cases (and to what extent) will annotated communities correspond
to the network structure.

An excursion into the edge-linear-time algorithms toolbox

Abstract:
A fundamental goal in algorithm design for graph problems is to come up 
with algorithms whose running time scales as a linear function of the 
number of edges in the input graph. My intent is to review selected 
such designs for NP-hard problems that are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT);
in particular, the exponential complexity of the problem can be isolated 
to a parameter of the input that is independent of the size of the graph.
