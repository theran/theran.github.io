The associahedron is a polytope whose vertices correspond to binary trees with n nodes and whose edges correspond to rotations between these trees. In this talk, I will review a classical construction of this polytope and present generalizations to related families of polytopes such as permutreehedra and quotientopes. Based on joint works with Viviane Pons (Univ. Orsay) and Francisco Santos (Univ. Cantabria).
