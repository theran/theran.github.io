 The rotation distance problem is simply: What is the maximum number of "rotations" required to transform one finite rooted binary tree into another? Is there a polynomial time algorithm which can compute this number? In this survey talk, we will explore the history of this problem and its link with both computer science and Thompson theory. In particular, we will be focusing on work by Patrick Dehornoy. Time permitting, we will present an algorithm which we hope provides some headway into answering an open question posed by Dehornoy.
