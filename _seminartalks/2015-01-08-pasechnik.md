The problem of reconstructing a measure in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ from a (truncated)
multi-sequence of its moments has important applications, and is in
general very hard to solve. We concentrate on a natural case of a
measure mu with piecewise-polynomial density supported on a compact
polyhedron $$P$$, and show that such problems can be solved exactly, due
to existence of a natural integral transform of the measure (known as
Fantappie transformation), which is a rational function $$F_\mu(u)$$.

The denominator of $$F_\mu(u)$$ is the product of linear functions of the
form $$1-\langle u,v\rangle$$, with $$v$$ belonging to certain finite multiset $$V(P)$$.
$$F_\mu(u)$$ is closely related to a more well-known Laplace transform
$$L_\mu(u)$$ of a related “conified” measure arising in the theory of
hyperplane arrangements. 

There are interesting applications of $$L_\mu$$ to compact (not
necessarily convex) polyhedra $$P$$. Let $$I(P)$$ be the indicator function of
$$P$$. Then $$I(P)$$ can be decomposed (up to a measure $$0$$ subset) as a sum,
with $$+1$$ or $$-1$$ coefficients, of $$I(D)$$, where $$D$$ runs through simplices
with vertices in $$V(P)$$. This can be viewed as a non-convex
generalisation of triangulations of convex polytopes. Further
refinements and applications will be discussed.
